				<h4>Q. Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two 				scenarios?</h4>

				<p>A couple of options come to my mind when using a login for Twitter, the biggest one is it gives a way for your app to be 				able to verify and authenticate who the user is. Secondly it can be used to link your app with the persons Twitter account, 				much like many games now allow you to login using Facebook instead of creating an account with the game or just playing as a 				guest. In terms of sending payments using Twitter I actually found a company using a Google search that has done just this, 				it is called Dwolla and all it requires is a person to setup an account at the Dwolla website to link their Twitter account 				and then all a person needs to do is tweet someone with a dollar amount and hash-tag Dwolla. I could see a lot of apps using 				something like this, especially one designed for selling good to people, no longer would someone need multiple accounts, 					just have a Twitter account to integrate with the app and easily buy and sell goods in your own app.</p>
				
				<h4>Q. Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</h4>
				
				<p>We need to use JSON-P as developers because it allows us to access data from outside domains which is typically 							restricted by web browsers because of the same origin policy we learned about in a previous course. This in turn empowers us 				to pull that data from the other domain and display it in our own website/app, one of the main uses of an API.</p>
				
				<h4>Q. Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native 					device features?</h4>
				
				<p><strong>Geolocation</strong><br />
				Climbingweather - Since it would be great to know what to expect from your climb using your geolocation you would be able to 				get the weather in your location quickly, rather than having to search for it.</p>
				
				<p>Stubhub – A really easy and nice way to automatically give a area for ticket pickup if it would be required for those 					tickets, again to save time of having to contact the buyer with the information.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Camera</strong><br />
				eBay Selling – A user would be able to use the camera to take a picture while in your custom app and then use the image 					taken and make a new eBay sell posting using the eBay API.</p>
				
				<p>Instagram – A user would be able to take photos while inside of your app and then easily upload to their Instagram 						account.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Capture</strong> <br />
				Google Drive – This would allow a user to capture audio/video/images and then let them upload to their Google Drive for 					storage while still within your application.</p>
				
				<p>Dropbox – Again would allow a user to take quick audio/video/images and upload to their Dropbox so they can later access 				it anywhere they want and not take up extra storage on their devices.</p>
				
				<h4>Q. Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</h4>
				
				<p>During this month one of the required API's to use is Instagram and as such I will be mashing that up with Camera 						feature. For my mashups since it is now football season I plan on using a Weather API and use Geolocation with it to give 					someone quick game day weather information as they are heading out to the game. I also would like to find a specific 						Football Stats API that will allow me to display stats and let the user input so they can find information for their 						specific team.</p>
				
				<h4>Q. Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding work flow as it relates to research, design, development, 					etc.</h4>
				
				<p>I have been beating this drum for the last few months now and I cannot stress enough with starting my projects early, I 					try and start them in most cases Fridays right after our previous assignment is completed. I begin by researching what I may 				need to in order to accomplish the tasks for the given week, while using Google to quickly find valuable resources as well 					as Stackoverflow for additional help if I run into a coding issue. My design work usually evolves as I add in features 						within JS as I make adjustments based on what my code does to the website. I usually very picky when it comes to how 						information is displayed within my app and as such I try and keep it as clean and crisp looking as I possibly can. Once I 					begin my development I try and set out certain goals every day, for example in ASD for our final project my goal for a day 					would perhaps be getting Save and Delete work for the CRUD and then the next day would be my Display and Edit. I have found 				this to be a very good way for me to stay on task and focused on what I need to accomplish each day.</p>
